![comfyUI节点-VAESave|保存VAE](https://comfyui-wiki.com/advanced/model_merging/VAESave.jpg)
## Documentation[](https://comfyui-wiki.com/en/comfyui-nodes/advanced/model-merging/vae-save#documentation)
  * Class name: `VAESave`
  * Category: `advanced/model_merging`
  * Output node: `True`


The VAESave node is designed for saving VAE models along with their metadata, including prompts and additional PNG information, to a specified output directory. It encapsulates the functionality to serialize the model state and associated information into a file, facilitating the preservation and sharing of trained models.
## Input types[](https://comfyui-wiki.com/en/comfyui-nodes/advanced/model-merging/vae-save#input-types)
Parameter | Comfy dtype | Description  
---|---|---  
`vae` | `VAE` | The VAE model to be saved. This parameter is crucial as it represents the model whose state is to be serialized and stored.  
`filename_prefix` | `STRING` | A prefix for the filename under which the model and its metadata will be saved. This allows for organized storage and easy retrieval of models.  
## Output types[](https://comfyui-wiki.com/en/comfyui-nodes/advanced/model-merging/vae-save#output-types)
The node doesn’t have output types.
