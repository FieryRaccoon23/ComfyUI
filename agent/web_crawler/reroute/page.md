Node Name: Reroute Node Node Purpose: Mainly used to organize the logic of overly long connection lines in the ComfyUI workflow.
## How to Use Reroute Nodes[](https://comfyui-wiki.com/en/comfyui-nodes/utils/reroute#how-to-use-reroute-nodes)
![ComfyUI Reroute Node Usage Example](https://comfyui-wiki.com/_next/static/media/reroute-example.7b1e8221.jpg)
Menu Options | Description  
---|---  
Show Type | Display the node’s type property  
Hide Type By Default | Hide the node’s type property by default  
Set Vertical | Set the node’s wiring direction to vertical  
Set Horizontal | Set the node’s wiring direction to horizontal  
When your wiring logic is too long and complex, and you want to tidy up the interface, you can insert a `Reroute` node between two connection points. The input and output of this node are not type-restricted, and the default style is horizontal. You can change the wiring direction to vertical through the right-click menu.
